## How to generate development/ production builds:
**We will need to rebuild again if:**

1. We added/removed/updated native modules (like expo-notifications, react-native-maps, etc.)

2. We changed something in android/, ios/, or app.json that affects native config

3. We're upgrading Expo SDK version

4. We want to publish a new .apk or .aab for Play Store submission

5. A new user can rebuild the application by the following commands

```bash
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```   
Go to https://expo.dev to create a free account

```bash
eas login
```
Enter your email and password to login.

Then initialize EAS via:
```bash
eas init
```

For development build:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```
```bash
npx expo start
```

For production build (.aab file for publishing the app on Play Store)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

*Note:* To build a production .apk change the eas.json file's production block as:

```bash
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    }

```
